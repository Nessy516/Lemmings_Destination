# Lemmings Destination (In Development)

*November 13, 2017 -*

A fan-made pack of Lemmings levels from the mind of a lunatic named Nessy that promises a unique and mind-boggling pack of adventure, romance, and salvation.

Can you guide your favorite rodents through 100 levels filled with dangerous traps and locations from the burning pits of heck to the morally questionable abandoned factories... all under a kick-butt soundtrack!

Don't forget to enjoy some delicious pizza and a cold beer (or water) at the end of the pack!

## Story

Almost 200 years after "The Great Lemming Migration" and its story is now a mere legend that only a handful of elders can remember inaccurately. Regardless, our cute little rodents have accomplished grand things in the meantime. They have build a new metropolis from the ground up that serves as a sanctuary to all Lemmings from around the world. A sanctuary to all lemmings who wish to escape the mysterious "cataclysm" and to escape the on-going need to solve puzzles in dangerous landscapes just to migrate to warmer climates. It's time to go beyond survival and reach one destination that will end all destinations.

Only you can successfully guide these cute rodents through 100 levels and get them safely to their new home again! Can you do it?

## Difficulties

This pack is divided into seven ranks:

1. ### Helium (Easy levels)

    These levels are nice and light, and you may simply float through them. Don't get too comfortable though, as these levels aren't complete pushovers. X-of-everything levels are rare as your first simple puzzles with limited skills will be presented right away!

2. ### Neon (Tricky levels)

    Now the neon glow of menacing difficulty will begin. These levels are some more simple puzzles with limited skills, but solutions require a little bit more thinking now.

3. ### Argon (Challenging levels)
    
    Things start getting heavier now. The levels start becoming a bit more complex and solutions will challenge your ideals and beliefs... well no just your solving skills really.

4. ### Xenon (Very challenging levels)
    
    Here we are at the odd child of the five ranks... more Wicked and Taxing than ever! They take pride in their penultimate position and will gladly start presenting you with some tough levels that are almost borderline insanity.

5. ### Radon (Just-ripe-your-hair-out levels!)
    
    Levels are now just radioactive, and a huge health risk to anyone unprepared. You've come too far now, can you really turn back? Levels are even more complex and require max creative thinking on how you use all your skills and how you approach even the simplest of strategies. Just remember to never give up!

6. ### Synthetic (Bonus Levels)

    Because a bonus rank is always the best rank right? :P Made in a lab and unable to occur in nature, these levels are mostly contest levels gathered together into one rank.

7. ### Fallout (Rejected Levels)
    
    An apocalyptic bonus rank for all the levels that couldn't make it into the main rank.
